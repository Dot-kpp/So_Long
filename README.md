# So_Long
The So Long project is a mandatory part of the 42 cursus. The project involves creating a basic 2D game in which a character (such as a dolphin) must escape a certain place (such as Earth) by collecting some type of collectible (such as fish). To complete the project, you must submit the following files: a Makefile, header files with the extension *.h, source code files with the extension *.c, and any maps that are used in the game.

The trick is, the game must be created using the MLX library. A student created library that emulates, in a way.. some of the libx or X11 functions.
